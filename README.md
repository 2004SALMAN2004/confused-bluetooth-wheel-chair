### Project Description
The Confused Bluetooth Wheelchair is a playful twist on a normal Bluetooth-controlled wheelchair.
Instead of following the usual commands, it intentionally does the opposite.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Now, you’ll have to think in reverse, adapt on the fly, and embrace the chaos of a wheelchair that does the exact opposite of what you want.
